## Git and HTTP

During the course, I learned not only to test, but also developed my skills in many directions, including:

* Learned to work with the GIT Tool (and GitHub)

* I learned the basics of REST API and network tools, thanks to which I will be able to test the back-end using the appropriate tools in my future work.

## Master Software Testing Certificate

Expanding my knowledge always make my happy, so I spend time on Udemy to self study . I was able to better understand software testing methodologies, focusing on agile projects with Master Software Tester course. It was great to learn better ways to grooming user story and how to explore the root of an issue and bring it to developers.
Also I learned usage of Xray on Jira for all QA activities, bug report on Bugzilla and new ways of using SQL operators.
